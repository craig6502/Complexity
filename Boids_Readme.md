# Boids and Complexity

Craig Reynolds was working in computer graphics and came up with 'boids' idea.  See Melissa Mitchell's talk.

## Implementation

For some pseudocode this is a good start:

## Applications

Simulating on-field behaviours for sports.

## Agents and behaviours

Langton's Ants are perfect, never tire even after 10,000+ reps.  

Could alter this and have a random mistake, or tiredness, or sleep etc, maybe pickup in a different direction.  

## Imperfect agents

Mutation was an aspect of Tom Ray's work.

In Craig Reynolds' simulations, the sensory imperfections were acknowledged and allowed for to some extent:
